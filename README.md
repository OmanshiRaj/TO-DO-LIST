# TO-DO-LIST
A simple and responsive To-Do List application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add, delete, and mark tasks as completed, with all data stored in the browser using localStorage for persistence. This project is great for learning the basics of DOM manipulation, event handling, and client-side storage in JavaScript.
